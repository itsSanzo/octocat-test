When working on a big collaboration project (like open-source projects), you can't work and push directly to the original repo: changes need to be moderated. To work on this kind of projects you need to clone the original repo on your own computer, then push the changes to your own repo on Github, then request them to be accepted on the original repo.

If you're working on your computer, pulling from the usual remote (origin) will only download files from your own github folder. To keep track of the files of the original project you need to add another remote named "upstream remote"
